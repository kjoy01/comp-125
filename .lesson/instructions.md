# Project 3 - Online Game

*Create a simple 2-D game for the web!*

Each student will turn in their own original work. This is not a group project, but I am hoping you will work in teams to troubleshoot and assist each other.

If you're OK with a grade of no more than 85% (B), you can turn in the results of Labs 12-16 for a very basic but functional game. If you want higher than a 'B', you have to put some personal creativity into it!

## Minimum features of your game project:

* A "splash" screen with an introduction to your game, a "play" screen where the game happens, a "game over" screen that the player sees when the game ends
* Objects that move independently on screen (arrays, individual objects, etc)
* Object constructor code contained in separate .js files (linked * An object controlled by the user (in "Pong" it's the paddle, in "Frogger" it's the Frog, in "Space Invaders" it's your ship, etc)
* A Timer that controls something in the game (appearance of additional objects, a time limit on a challenge, etc.)
* An action that the user takes that scores points (eliminate threats, keep a ball in play, reach a goal, etc)
* A display of points on screen (visual feedback)

### Other features that will make your game better:

* Better graphics (make your own sprite objects)
* Multiple levels
* Multiple objectives
* Multiple objects with different purposes (more than one type of obstacle or objective)

## What to submit:

* a **link** to your project (here in Sakai)
* a short **commentary** in the submission box to explain your game and the techniques you used to create it. Please cite your sources if you looked at models or borrowed any code.
* a **.zip archive** of your project uploaded here as an attachment
* Also a good idea: **GitHub** repository with commits for each step of the project

## How will I evaluate this?

* **Functionality** (30 points): Your code should work properly with no errors. It should be submitted on time. The game should work as advertised
* **Technique** (30 points): How well did you use the tools and techniques we learned this term? I'm looking for sophisticated and creative use of all the programming skills we have covered so far
* **Readability** (30 points): Is formatting (indentation, spacing, etc) correct? Are comments thorough and helpful? Is it clear what's going on in your code? Are variables and functions named logically so that someone else can understand what you're trying to do?
* **Creativity** (10 points): Is your game interesting? entertaining? clever? Does it bring in your own creative ideas or rely too heavily on the templates, labs, and examples?

**Please email me if you want help, comments, or feedback.**

### Addendum: Collaboration allowed/encouraged

For this project, I encourage you to find a buddy in this class with whom you might collaborate in any number of ways. First of all, it's good to have someone to brainstorm with. Also, it's great to have someone that can test and help debug/troubleshoot. For this project, I would not object if you actually shared code with one another as long as it is properly credited. For instance, if you have an object constructor that you have created that could be used in a colleague's game, and you would like to share it, go ahead. Just make sure the name of the person that created it is prominently displayed in a code comment. Always give credit for creative contributions from others!

So, while this is not actually a group project, I would be delighted to know that you are actually working together.
