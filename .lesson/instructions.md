# Labs 12-17 - Online Game

*Create a simple 2-D game for the web!*

Each student will turn in their own original work. This is not a group project, but I am hoping you will work in teams to troubleshoot and assist each other.

We will complete a series of five lab exercises (see the **Lab assignments in Sakai** for detailed instructions) to help move this project along. Each step is relatively simple, but will add some new functionality to your project. The steps are as follows:

1. Start-Play-GameOver (Lab 12): make your project branch to three different screens based on user action (mouse click). See the [Video Walkthrough](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9f39bf41-8e5f-4c77-a2db-ade90168bf86)
2. Player 1 movement (Lab 13): import a constructor function for a Player object. Make it move on screen in response to user actions (keyboard). See the [Video Walkthrough](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0bc14413-f7bb-42ab-b01d-adf200e2a8e4)
3. Timers (Lab 14): import a Timer object constructor and an object to place in an array. Use the timer to control the appearance of objects in the game. See the [Video Walkthrough](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2cc79432-a549-44eb-87f6-adf201765857)
4. Object Collisions (Lab 15): check for intersections between objects on the canvas. Make decisions about what to do when a collision is detected. See the [Video Walkthrough](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=be674df6-f447-4b60-9daf-adf8005a248f)
5. Scoring (Lab 16): decide how you want to award (or subtract) points in your game. How does your game end? Place some logic code in a few key places to make your game progressive (moving towards a goal). See the [Video Walkthrough](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=17b0a2c5-413a-44e0-91e1-ae000129389d)

**For each lab** you will pick up where you left off. Each time you complete a lab exercise, **download a .zip archive** of your work and **submit it in Sakai** as a lab. This way, you not only document each step (for lab credit) but you will have saved backups of your project at each critical step.

Also, each time you finish a lab, make sure you **commit** it on **GitHub**. This will make it easy to step back to the last working version in case something goes horribly wrong.

Once you are done, you can submit this tutorial as "Project 3" for a grade of at least 85% (B). I'm hoping you go beyond the basics to make something fun and unique. To earn higher than a 'B' on the project, you will need to add your own creative ideas and objects. You can do that here as we go along, or work in parallel using the "Game 3" Project on replit.
